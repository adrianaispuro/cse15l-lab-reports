# Lab Report 1 - Remote Connections

In this lab report, I'll be showing you how to access your `ieng6` account and remotely connect to a computer in the CSE basement.

* A quick note: I'll be occasionally alternating between saying Visual Studio Code and its abbreviation VSCode.

***

## What you'll need (and important links)

* [Virtual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - If you don't have it already downloaded, do that now; you'll need it beyond this point in this class. 

* [UCSD Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
    - This is the link to access your student account (including your course-specific accounts)

* [OpenSSH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui)
    - For anyone using Windows, you will need to download OpenSSH to make the remote connection since the server only accepts secured connections.

***

## Step 1: Downloading Visual Studio Code

* If you already have VSCode installed and ready, skip to step 2; otherwise, keep reading.

Go to the VSCode website linked above and download the version compatible with your computer.

(*Note:* You **need** a computer that can run VSCode offline; this process will not work if you are using the browser-based version of VSCode. Sorry tablet/Chromebook users üôÅ)

After the install finishes, open VSCode; your screen should now resemble this: (The format/color theme may vary depending on device)

## Step 1.5: Installing OpenSSH (non-Windows users - skip ahead)

For anyone using Windows, you have an extra step: downloading/activating OpenSSH. Click the OpenSSH link above and you'll be taken to a Microsoft page; scroll down to this section and follow the instructions:

## Step 2: Setting up your course-specific account

Next, go the Account Lookup page linked above and you'll be greeted by a page that should look like this:

![Account Lookup login page](./account%20lookup%20login.png)

Enter your login information, then click "Submit Query". If the login succeeded, you'll see something like the following:

![Account Lookup result page](./account%20lookup%20page.png)

You should notice a clickable button under "Additional Accounts" with text that looks like "`cs15lXXXXXX`". This is your account specifically made for this course. 

* The last six characters will differ when you access this page; this screenshot was taken during the Fall 2022 quarter (the `fa22` part) and the last two characters are unique to your account (mine are `ix`).

Click on the button, and the web should take you here:

![CS15L account page](./CS15L%20account%20page.png)

Since this is your first time accessing this account, you'll probably see an alert to reset your password. Go ahead and click through and reset your password.

* *Note:* there'll be a roughly 15-minute cooldown after you change/set your password before the servers will reflect the change.

## Step 3a: Making a Remote Connection

* From this point on, I'll specify where to make commands. For terminal commands on the client (the computer physically in front of you) I'll use <font color = "0c7bdc">the color blue.</font> For terminal commands on the server (the computer you're connecting to over the Internet) I'll use <font color = "green"> the color green.</font>

On 
<font color = 0c7bdc>your computer</font>, start VSCode and open a new terminal.

* Click the "New Terminal" option in the "Terminal" menu or use keyboard shortcut `` CTRL + ` `` or ``command + ` ``, depending on your system.

In the terminal, type the following command and press `enter`:

``` ssh cs15lxxxxxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu```

* Make sure you type a lowercase L "l", not the number one "1".

The first time you connect to the server, you'll see a warning mentioning "authenticity can't be established"; this is expected, go ahead and type `yes` and press `enter`.

Once you enter your password and successfully log in, your screen will fill up with information about usage information that'll look like this:

![log in output on terminal](ssh%20login%20output.png)

* If you run into issues logging into your `ieng6` account, try resetting your `cse15l` account password again and wait 15-30 minutes. If you still have issues, reach out to your professor or TAs.

 Otherwise, if you've made it this far, congrats! You connected your terminal to the server; now we can use some commands on the terminal to access files on <font color = "orange">the server.</font>
